				It's Monday, 8:30am and Nancy has a furniture design review meeting at 1pm. She needs to finalize the list of furniture products that will fit well with the futuristic living room collection. This will enable the product design team to see if their next batch of living room furniture products are in align with company design standards and/or part of a style trend.

			<p>Nancy proceeds to login to contempodesign.com, navigates to the living room furniture section, clicks on the black, faux leather adjustable chair, then clicks on the heart button, which indicates that it is a favorite item. </p>
